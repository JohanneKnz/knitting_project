## Design
### Colour scheme
The website uses a palette of muted colours and blue, inspired by the calm colours of the scandinavian coast.

Google Fonts was used for the following fonts:
- Cinzel is used for headings on the site.
- Roboto is used for the body text on the site.
- Sans serif is used as a back-up font on the site.

### Imagery
The project images are owned by the creator of the page. The background picture is a copyright free picture. I have credited this in the credits section.

### Videos
The tutorial videos are linked from YouTube. I have credited this in the credtis section.

### Responsiveness
Adaptations were made to fit screens of different sizes.

## Features
The website is comprised of five pages, three of which are accessible from the navigation menu (home page, project page & knit along page). The fourth page is a library with videos on basic knitting techniques accessible from the knit along page and the home page. The fifth page is a contact us page where users can contact Knots and Loops.

All Pages on the website have:

A responsive navigation bar at the top which allows the user to navigate through the site. To the left of the navigation bar is the Knots and Loops text. To the right of the navigation bar are the links to the websites pages (home, projects, and knit along). When viewing with mobile devices the navigation links appear below the logo text on the left.

A footer which contains social media icon links to social media (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Youtube). There is also an envelope icon which takes the user to the contact us page. Icons were used to keep the footer clean and because they are universally recognisable.

### Home Page.
#### Welcome image
The welcome image is a picture of yarn, keeping with the theme of the page and color scheme. The picture also includes a text book with a short description of Knots and Loops.

#### About Us.
This section is broken down into two subsections and reflects the purpose of the page and on knitting through knit alongs. On large screens the subsections are laid out side by side, however on mobile devices the subsections are stacked vertically.

#### Knit along section.
This section gives the user more information on the current knit along and how they can join future knit alongs with Knots and Koops.

### Projects Page. 
This takes the user to the project galary, where pictures of past projects are included. On large screens the projects are shown in 4 columns, on smaller screens the projects are shown in 3 or 2 columns, depending on the size of the screen.

### Knit along page
This page provides the user with more inforamtion about the knit along and contains a form where the user can join the next knit along and provide their project preferences. The form contains fields for the users name, email address, checkboxes indicating the users project prefernces and radio boxes for indicating the users level of experience. The user submits the form using the submit button. Users must fill in the name, email and indicate their level of experience with the radio buttons to be able to submit the form.

### Tutorials Page
This page allows the user to request a mentor and access videos on basic knitting techniques. The form contains fields for the users name, email address, and message. The user submits the form using the submit button. Users must fill in the name, email and text area fields to be able to submit the form.

### Contact Us Page.
This page opens in a new tab and allows users to submit a message to Knots and Loops. The form contains fields for the users name, email address, and message. The user submits the form using the submit button. Users must fill in the name, email and text area fields to be able to submit the form.

## Future Implementations. 
Use javascript to perform return to top function on project page. Use javascript to add a feature to vote for what type of project users want the next knit along to be. A mentor page - This would have a photo of the mentors together with a small bio. The page would match users with mentors who are availiable to assist people with their projects. I would also like to add a link to their instagram and/or YouTube page.

Use javascript to make the checkboxes in the knit along form required.

## Accessibility 
I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. I have achieved this by:
- Using semantic HTML.
- Using descriptive alt attributes on images on the site.
- Providing information for screen readers where there are icons used and no text - such as the footer icons.
- Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.
- Ensuring menus are accessible by marking the current page as current for screen readers.

## Deployment and local deployment
### Deployment
Github Pages was used to deploy the live website. The instructions to achieve this are below:

Log in (or sign up) to Github.
- Find the repository for this project, knitting-project.
- Click on the Settings link.
- Click on the Pages link in the left hand side navigation bar.
- In the Source section, choose main from the drop down select branch menu. Select Root from the drop down select folder menu.
- Click Save. Your live Github Pages site is now deployed at the URL shown.

#### Local Development
##### How to Fork
To fork the knitting-project repository:
- Log in (or sign up) to Github.
- Go to the repository for this project, JohanneKnz/knitting-project.
- Click the Fork button in the top right corner.

##### How to Clone
To clone the knitting-project repository:
- Log in (or sign up) to GitHub.
- Go to the repository for this project, JohanneKz/knitting-project.
- Click on the code button, select whether you would like to clone with HTTPS, SSH or GitHub CLI and copy the link shown.
- Open the terminal in your code editor and change the current working directory to the location you want to use for the cloned directory.
- Type 'git clone' into the terminal and then paste the link you copied in step 3. Press enter.

## Testing
Testing was ongoing throughout the entire build. I utilised Chrome developer tools while building to pinpoint and troubleshoot any issues as I went along.

The following issues were raised during my mid project meeting with my mentor:
- Gap widths on certain pages leaves too much space between sections, especially on certain screen sizes. This was resolved by adding a fourth media screen and tailoring the length of the sections in each media screen as needed.
- The checkboxes in the knit along form should be deselected to confirm with best practise. With pre-selected checkboxes the user has to deselect and select their input. The checked attribute was removed from the checkboxes. A future implimentation will be to add javascript to the checkboxes to make it required to select at least one.
- The input field in the contact us form should be changed to a textarea field to allow for longer messages in a better way. This was added.
- The background for the form input fields should be white when writing text, so the text is easier to read for the users. This was amended with adding a focus pseodo class, making the background fields white when the user is typing.
- The YouTube videos on the tutorials page are in iframe format. Best practise would be to use different code. The iFrames were changed to objects.
- Additional media element could be added for very small screens, thus making the specific code for these smaller screens more tailored. This was added, also in association with the gap width as detailed above.

### W3C Validator
The W3C validator was used to validate the HTML on all pages of the website. It was also used to validate CSS in the style.css file.

Initial testing:
- h1 header on index page - W3C suggested to not use the h1 header as it was used in the page already.
- iframe instead of css on the tutorials page - W3S suggested to avoid using the ifram code, recomending to use css. As the code is sourced from YouTube, and I wanted to be consistent with the source of this content keeping with the origin of the videos, this was disregarded.

### Solved Bugs
The navbar would lose its alignment when on smaller devices, with the knit along link being oushed down to the following line, underneathe the other icons on the right side of the page. This did not make for a good user experience, and looked messy. Once I added a narrower margin in the media element for smaller devices the navigation was alligned on one line on smaller screen.

The responsiveness on very small screens presented issues, as the height on the sections would be too long or not long enough depending on the device. After some testing and discussing it with my mentor, I added a fourth media screen for screens under 400px. This allowed me more flexibility and control over the sections, which were tested in the developer tool on several screen sizes.

The YouTube videos were initially coded as iFrames, as this was the suggested code from YouTube. The W3S validator sugggested to not use iFrames. Using objects instead was suggested by my mentor, and this was implimeted based on code from slack in refernce to YouTube. The credits for this code is listed in the credits section.

### Known Bugs
The project page is repoted to have a slow responsiveness. This is due to not having fixed width on the images. As the page is coded to be responsive by adapting columns from 4 columns to 3 columns to 2 columns, I did not specify width. The bug was not fixed, but could possibly be fixed with a query or more media screens.

The in-text links are not bolded on firefox browsers. A future fix could be to add an alternate menu, or further link attributes. This bug was not fixed, and is showing on firefow browsers.

### Lighthouse
I used Lighthouse within the Chrome Developer Tools to allow me to test the performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO of the website.

#### Index Page
Initial lighthouse testing suggested to serve images in next-gen formats. Lighthouse suggests using image formats such as WebP & AVIF to improve compression and lead to faster downloads and less data consumption. I have now converted the logo and slide images to webp format using Birme.

### Full Testing
To fully test my website I performed the following testing using a number of browsers (google chrome, safari, firefox) and  I went through each page using google chrome developer tools to ensure that they responsive on all different screen sizes.

#### Links.
Test each link on the index page. Each link worked as expected, and any links leading to external pages opened correctly in a seperate browser tab.
Test each link on the projects page. Each link worked as expected, and any links leading to external pages opened correctly in a seperate browser tab.
Test each link on the knit along page. Each link worked as expected, and any links leading to external pages opened correctly in a seperate browser tab.
Test each link on the tutorial page. Each link worked as expected, and any links leading to external pages opened correctly in a seperate browser tab.
Test each link on the contact us page. Each link worked as expected, and any links leading to external pages opened correctly in a seperate tab.

#### Forms.

Test the knit along form. 
- I tried to submit the form without filling in any input fields. The form worked correctly and directed users to fill in the name field. 
- I then filled in the name fields and tried to submit the form. Again the form worked correctly and directed the user to fill out the email field. 
- I filled out the name and email forms and tried to submit the form. The formworked correctly and directed users to chose level of difficulty.
- I filled in the level of dificulty and the preselected checkboxes to submit the form. The form then opens in the code instetute formdump to demonstrate the selctors have been coded correctly.

Test the mentor form. 
- I tried to submit the form without filling in any input fields. The form worked correctly and directed users to fill in the name field. 
- I then filled in the name field and tried to submit the form. Again the form worked correctly and directed the user to fill out the email field.  
I filled in the email field to submit the form. The form then opens in the code instetute formdump to demonstrate the selctors have been coded correctly.

Test the contact us form. 
- I tried to submit the form without filling in any input fields. The form worked correctly and directed users to fill in the name field. 
- I then filled in the name field and tried to submit the form. Again the form worked correctly and directed the user to fill out the email field.  
- I filled out the email field and tried to submit the form. Again the form worked correclty and directed the user to fill out the message field.
I filled in the message field to submit the form. The form then opens in the code instetute formdump to demonstrate the selctors have been coded correctly.
